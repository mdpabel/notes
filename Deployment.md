## Deployment Processes

The process of deployment involves 3 activities:

1. Provisioning Hardware: Setting up servers (physical or cloud) to run your app.
2. Installing & Configuring Software: Adding the tools and settings your app needs to work (like databases, web servers, etc.).
3. Deploying Application Code: Moving your app's code to the server and making it live for users.
